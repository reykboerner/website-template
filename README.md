# Conference website template

This repo contains a template for a one-page conference website using HTML and CSS, based on the website created for our conference [Metastability and Tipping in Complex Systems](https://reykboerner.github.io/metastability24).

Design by Reyk based on the HTML5UP theme by @ajlkn.
